# [Unity/C#] Tutorials

**Mina PÃªcheux - Since November 2022**

<img style="width: 128px; margin: 1rem 0;" src="doc/unity-square.png" />

This repo contains the code and assets for the various Unity/C# tutorials I published as texts/videos on YouTube and Medium (ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ + ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·).

---

As of now, the repo contains some global assets/settings, and personal libraries (in the `Assets/Dependencies/` folder), like:

- `BehaviorTree`: A basic C# library implementing abstract node and tree structures to create behaviour trees. You can see an example of usage in [Tutorial 01: Using behaviour trees for a RTS collector AI](#tutorial-01_bts-rts).
- `AStar`: A basic C# library with A* pathfinding algorithms. For now, it's only for 2D tilemaps - the code was adapted from [this great Github](https://github.com/pixelfac/2D-Astar-Pathfinding-in-Unity) by pixelfac.

---

And in the `Assets/` folder, you'll find the code and assets for the following tutorials:

## 01. Using behaviour trees for a RTS collector AI [<div />](#tutorial-01_bts-rts)

Discover how to use the behaviour tree AI design pattern to give some life to RTS collector units! These little trucks will chop down
trees or mine ores to gather wood and minerals, auto-finding the closest targets and regularly delivering their resources to a nearby
depot, until the entire map is empty...

## 02. Creating a day-and-night cycle system [<div />](#tutorial-02_day-and-night)

Learn how to setup a basic day-and-night cycle in a 2D scene, by changing the global light and toggling some smaller spots.

## 03. How to use Unity's new input system [<div />](#tutorial-03_new-input-system)

Want to learn more about Unity's new InputSystem package, and how you can use it to create basic cross-platform player controller that supports
            both gamepads and keyboard+mouse layouts? Then check out this quick tutorial :)

- Watch on YouTube: [in English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§](https://youtu.be/SyA4PPiXorI), [in French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5ePVtQq-zo)
- Read on [Medium](https://medium.com/codex/why-you-should-use-unitys-new-input-system-268773863c4)
- See the files [in the repo](/Assets/03-NewInputSystem/)

**Important note:** The repo contains an extended version of the `HeroController.cs` script we make in the YouTube video with additional camera control (you can find it in the `HeroControllerWithCamera.cs` script). To use it, replace the `HeroController` component with the `HeroControllerWithCamera` on the "Hero" object, and then disable the "Aim" feature of the Cinemachine camera, so the script is free to rotate the view as it wants :)
